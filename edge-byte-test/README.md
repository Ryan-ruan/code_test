## Description

You can change any element of the website, but you must use the current logo.
 
Questions that would be good for you to answer and will be assessed on:

* Names used for class and CSS styles
* Ability to clean up of the inline styles
* Ability to integrate a framework and make the site responsive ( which framework did they use) if any
* Quality of recommendations to make the homepage look more modern. What would you change about the current homepage?
* Please only supply working HTML wireframe.
 
You do not need to complete an entire website re-design. We are more interested in the code you would use and the working HTML wireframe you would produce to show stakeholders. The test should only take around 2 hours if you do spend longer please let us know as it is important we get a grasp of you skill sets for this role.

## About my code-test

### Responsive
* I decided to use the framework called [Semantic-UI]. The structure of Semantic UI components is much more difficult than Bootstrap, as is the installation process. While Bootstrap provides only one basic theme, Semantic UI includes more than 20+ themes in its basic package, in addition to CSS, JS, and fonts files.


### modern look
* CSS animations/transitions
* clean front page with a typing animation.
* responsive design
<del>* CSS sprites for faster image/icon loading,not many icons for this page
